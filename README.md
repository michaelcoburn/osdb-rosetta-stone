# The opensource database Rosetta stone

While database engines like MySQL and PostgreSQL have a lot in common, performing even simple management tasks on one or the other can be challenging and time consuming.  The aim of this project is to provide a basis as how these databases works and how to accomplish key management tasks.

## Databases

As a starting point, the focus is restricted to [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/) version 8.0.x and [PostgreSQL](https://postgresql.org) 12.x. Other opensource databases could be added in the future.  Keep in mind, this is a work in progress, the content will be enriched over time and it will need to be updated with the release of new versions of the databases.
